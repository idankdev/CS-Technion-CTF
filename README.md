# CS-Technion-CTF
Some of the scripts I wrote for the CS Technion CTF Challenges (Nov - Dec 2020).
Our team Psagot22 won the 3rd place in division 1 (Students who study first and second year in the Taub Faculty of Computer Science at the Technion).
Psagot22 has achieved 8510 points in the CTF and ended up at the 10th place overall.
